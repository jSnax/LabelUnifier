Instructions for using DomainThesaurus, PhraseStructureList and ForbiddenWords

DomainThesaurus:

A DomainThesaurus contains all words that are preferable in terms of synonym replacement. 
Having "small" in the DomainThesaurus would replace all instances of words like "tiny" or "miniscule" with "small" in the output.
By default, there are no words in the Thesaurus. To enter a word, simply enter it in the DomainThesaurus.txt located in your installation folder.
If you want to enter multiple words, separate them by a comma and an empty space. It could look like this:
account, payment, check



ForbiddenWords:

The ForbiddenWords list contains all words that should not be replaced with synonyms. For now, this only works with verbs.
The difference to DomainThesaurus is that words in this list also don't replace other words at all.
By default, the following verbs are in this list, named ForbiddenWords.txt in your installation folder: be, will, have, can, do
Verbs in this file need to be separated by a comma and an empty space, if you wish to add more, e.g. be, will, have, can, do, run


input:

The input.txt file located in your installation folder contains all labels that are supposed to be unified by this program.
Labels are entered separated by lines, meaning each line in this file denotes exactly one label.
Label may consist of multiple sentences separated by a "."
An example for input.txt might look like this:

Check invoice.
Verify bill.
Pay accountant. Update website.
Retrieve money from account.


PhraseStructureList:

A PhraseStructureList contains all sentence structures that are supposed to be generated by this program.
Labels you enter will be transformed adhering to those structures after synonym replacement.
There are some structures in this list by default.
It is possible to add more structures by entering a new line in the PhraseStructureList.txt file in your installation folder.
In order to do so, use this format:
y, NSS, VSP, NSO, AO, AO, Prep, POP, APO, ADV
The first character has to be either "y" or "n" and marks the structure as active (y) or inactive (n).
A structure that was marked inactive will not be used, but can simply be turned active by changing "n" to "y" again.
After that, separate elements by comma and blank space and use only elements from the list below.
While the order of the structure is mostly not important, keep in mind that adjectives have to come AFTER their respective noun.
E.g. "NSS, AS" would work while "AS, NSS" would not work.
Also, determiners need to be put BEFORE their respective noun.
E.g. "DetDef, NSS" would work while "NSS, DetDef" would not work.
Also, currently only a single verb, object and subject are supported.

Configure program:
To use the program add your absolute path to your folder containing the PhraseStructureList.txt, DomainThesaurus.txt and the ForbiddenWords.txt in the conf.txt.
The conf file must remain in the same folder as the .jar. PhraseStructureList.txt, DomainThesaurus.txt and the ForbiddenWords.txt can be edited as described above.
To use the program open a terminal and change to the directory containing the .jar and use "java -jar <jarName>.jar".
